This is ARM Docker image of the the [Official Tautilli-Docker](https://github.com/Tautulli/Tautulli-Docker). It is suitable for Raspberry and any ARM device.

This project, takes the source code from [Tautulli repository](https://github.com/Tautulli/Tautulli-Docker) and compile it for ARM device without perform any change to code. This means, still running the office source code provided by Tautilli. For unknown reasons Tautilli developers decided to not compile a ARM docker image
